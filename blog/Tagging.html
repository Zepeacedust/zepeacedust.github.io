        <p>So, I want to talk about a lot of things, but I understant
        that not everyone is interested in all of those things.</p>
        <p>So I am introducing <strong>Tags</strong>, neat little things
        that help me organize my rants into neat little slices, each
        with their own index.</p>
        <p>The note that I will probably bastardize the codebase that
        generates this site has already come true, not even a day later
        I have hacked some new functionality into an already dubiously
        clean codebase. I should eventually clean that up.</p>
        <p>The current tags as of posting are as follows: <a
        href="/blog/index_meta.html">Meta</a> for things related to the
        blog itself and <a href="/blog/index_coding.html">Coding</a> for
        my software misadventures. That number will most certainly grow
        and there should be a system already in place to create new
        indices and link to those indices from other indices.</p>
