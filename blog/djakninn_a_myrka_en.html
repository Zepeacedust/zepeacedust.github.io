        <p>A long time ago there was a deacon in the village of Myrká<a
        href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> around Eyjafjörður<a
        href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>; his name is not recorded.
        He was courting a woman by the name of Guðrún<a href="#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, by some accounts she lived
        at the village of Bægisá, on he other side of the river Hörgá,
        and was a maid to the priest there. The deacon had a gray maned
        horse, he rode him often and called him Faxi<a href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. One time as little while
        before christmas, the deacon made his way to Bægisá and invited
        Guðrún to a christmas feast in Myrká, he promised to fetch her
        in time for the feast which was on christmas eve.</p>
        <p>In the days before he went to invite her it had snowed
        considerably, and on that day it had started to melt. As the day
        passed and he tarried at Bægisá the river Hörgá had become
        impassable. When he finally left he paid no mind to the changing
        conditions, and assumed that the river flowed as it had earlier.
        He crossed the river Yxnadalsá by bridge, but when he came to
        the river Hörgá it had shifted. He rides along it until he
        reaches Saurbær, a town just below Myrká. There was a bridge he
        could cross. The deacon rides over the bridge, but on the biddle
        it collapses and he falls into the river. The morning after, as
        the farmer at Þúfnavöllur<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> was getting out
        of bed he sees Faxi and the bottom of his field and recognizes
        him as the deacons horse. This shakes him a little, as he saw
        the deacon on his travels to Bægisá just the day before, but
        hadn’t heard any news of his return. He quickly clues in to what
        must have happened and walks out to see Faxi soaking wet and
        worse for wear. He clambers down a steep slope down to the
        riverbank and finds the deacon washed up. He hurries to Myrká
        with the news. The deacon was badly injured at the back of the
        head, seemingly by an iceberg. He was moved back to Myrká and
        buried in the week before christmas.</p>
        <p>After the deacon left Bægisá and until christmas eve, no news
        could cross between the villages due to the river being
        impassable. But as the weather calms just before christmas, the
        river does as well, and Guðrún is relieved that she will not
        miss the feast. She starts preparing for the journey, and when
        she is mostly finished there is a knock at the door. Another
        woman at the town answers the door and sees nobody, as it is in
        the twilight hours and the moon seldom peeks between the clouds.
        The woman returns and claims to not have seen anything, and
        Guðrún says:</p>
        <aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Til mín mun leikurinn gjörður, og skal ég að vísu út
        ganga.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>They are calling for me, and I shall greet them.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>She had almost finished dressing, only missing her coat. She
        hurredly slipped on one sleeve, but laid the other over her
        shoulder and held it there. When she came out, she saw Faxi
        stand by the door, and a man she assumed was the deacon. It is
        not known whether they talked at all, but he took Guðrún and sat
        her on the horse, and himself in front of her. They rode that
        way for a while without talking, when they came to the river
        Hörgá the horse jumped over it, and the deacons hat lifted so
        Guðrún could see the back of his head, and the exposed skull. At
        that moment the moon appeared from amidst the clouds and the
        deacon spoke:</p>
        <aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Máninn líður,<br />
        dauðinn ríður;<br />
        sérðu ekki hvítan blett<br />
        í hnakka mínum,<br />
        Garún, Garún?</p>
        </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>the moon wains,<br />
        And death rides.<br />
        Do you see a white spot<br />
        on the back of my head,<br />
        Garún<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, Garún<a href="#fn7"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This frightened her, and she dared not speak. But some say
        that she lifted his hat, and saw his skull and said</p>
        <aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sé ég það, sem er.</p>
        </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I see that which is there.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Nothing more is said of their conversation before they arrive
        at Myrká, and disembarked before the gate to the cemetary<a
        href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, where the deacon again
        speaks:</p>
        <aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Bíddu hérna, Garún, Garún,<br />
        meðan eg flyt hann Faxa, Faxa,<br />
        upp fyrir garða, garða.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Wait here, Garún, Garún,<br />
        while I move Faxi, Faxi,<br />
        up to the fields, fields.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He quickly left with the horse, but Guðrún cast her eyes to
        the cemetary. There she saw an open grave and was frightened.
        She grabs the bell rope to steady herself and in that moment is
        grabbed from behind. Luckily she hadn’t fully donned her cloak,
        since she was then pulled with enough force to rip the sleeve
        from the cloak at the seams. The last she saw of the deacon, is
        as he falls with the torn cloak into the open grave. The force
        of the impact collapsing the walls and burying him.</p>
        <p>In her terror Guðrún rang the bell ceaselessly until a group
        from Myrká came to fetch her. She neither dared to stop, nor
        leave, as she thought it sure that she saw the deacon back from
        the dead, even without having heard news of his death. The same
        night, well after dark, the deacon came again to Myrká seeking
        Guðrún. The commotion was so great that the entire village was
        roused and nobody could sleep again till morning. For half a
        month afterwards Guðrún did not dare to be alone, and she could
        not sleep unless someone was awake. Some even say that she
        needed the priest to sit at her bedside and read from his
        psalter till she finally fell asleep..</p>
        <p>Peace did not come until they sought a sorcerer<a href="#fn9"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> from Skagafjörður<a
        href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. He made them dig up a
        large rock from one of the fields, and roll it into the village.
        That night, as the deacon again comes for Guðrún, the sorcerer
        forces him south with powerful incantations, and into a grave
        prepared earlier that day. Then the villagers roll the stone
        over the grave, and there it is said that the deacon is still
        trapped to this day. But afterwards the hauntings at Myrká
        stopped, and shortly afterwards Guðrún went home to Bægisá. It
        is said that she was never quite the same afterwards.</p>
