        </header>
        <p>This is not a techincal dissection, more of a narrative of
        the development of a pet project. It is relayed accurately, if
        you brush off the analogies of fighting mythic beasts. For the
        code itself see the <a
        href="https://github.com/Zepeacedust/AutoLibrarian">Github</a>.</p>
        <p>Like most projects, this one started as a minor annoyance in
        conversation about something petty. That initial conversation
        went something like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>A: Why does this work? B: By analogy to The Patient Spell A:
        What's the text on that again?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then I had an idea, what if it had went something like
        this:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>A: Why does this work? B: By analogy to [[The Patient
        Spell]]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And it would just link the spell automatically.</p>
        <p>Now there's a thought.</p>
        <p>Problem was: there is no accesible dataset that encompasses
        all the published spells. But there is a pdf that contains them
        all. So late at night I ripped the text from the pdf and set to
        work parsing it into something usable.</p>
        <p>I bring my strongest regular expression down on the beast,
        and come 2 past midnight I was satisfied with my handiwork. I
        had no intents of writing the fetcher itself soon anyways.</p>
        <p>Around noon the day after I am locked in mortal combat with
        <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson">Aeson</a>, a
        json parsing library that had promised much and delivered ~~fire
        and brimstone~~ obtuse errors and terse documentation.</p>
        <p>On its left was a beast of great power, wrought by my own
        hand, 6000 lines of json made by regular expressions and a
        sleep-deprived mind set on creation. And on its right was an
        error message of cold, austere beauty, Nothing at all.</p>
        <p>I took my old axe by the handle and started hacking,
        splitting the problem in twain until I found the solid core of
        error inside, when I found that error I analized it and forged a
        regular expression to kill it and its kind. One after the other
        I cut down the issues before me, heedless of the mountains of
        minor issues left behind. In my rage I had clobbered the spell
        levels, and homoginized the formatting, they were not
        semantically wrong so they must be correct.</p>
        <p>After I had parsed the beast, I built with its bones a spell
        fetcher, it showed the name, parameters, text and source of the
        requested spell. Behind the veneer of progress, I had shattered
        the foundations. This was the only json of its kind, should it
        not be good and legible? Should it not be accurate and precise?
        Is it not my duty to un-clobber the spell levels?</p>
        <p>From the mother of the beast I ripped a new text file, and
        armed with the weapons honed in the blood of its sibling I
        hacked this one into neater pieces. Aware of the errors of the
        past I made a json file, 10000 lines long, shining and
        beautiful.</p>
        <p><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson">Aeson</a>
        had been conquered, and the new parser was written over the
        mistakes of the past. A pure dataset leads to pure outputs.</p>
        <p>The requested spells were extracted with a regular
        expression, and sought for in the parsed json. Any matches were
        sent.</p>
        <p>But some were too big, at over 3500 characters the Aegis of
        the Hearth was too big to fit into a discord message. So any
        messages over a threshold were to be sent as a file instead
        (Sidenote: Why does discord not have native foldable message
        support?).</p>
        <p>The masses rejoiced, but there was trouble in paradise.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>A: Fuck you and your Covenant, I cast [[Stripping the
        Superfluous Reality]] B: Spell not found A: Fuck</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The masses, regrettably were not as perfect as the dataset,
        and what is a library that you cannot find the correct book in?
        I scrambled to the archives, and found an implementation of an
        edit distance algorithm, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein
        distance</a>. Instead of finding a perfect match, it selects the
        closest spell available. For short messages, this can get quite
        nonsensical, but it compensates for fairly major spelling
        differences in a reasonable timescale.</p>
        <p>This improved system led to a strange behaviour in the
        gathered wizard impersonators: They saw it as an oracle, asking
        to find them names and interpreting the resulting spells.</p>
        <p>My beautiful machine now rests on a raspberry pi on a desk,
        faithfully returning spells and hopefully making conversations
        about a game about pretending to be wizards just that bit more
        convenient.</p>
        <p>The feeling I get seeing someone enjoy something I made is
        next to none, the pride in seeing your creation work and meed or
        exceed expectations is intoxicating, I should share more things
        that I make. I guess that's what this blog is for, stay tuned
        for more nonsense.</p>
