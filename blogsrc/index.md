So, I was thinking, I dislike web design, but I have *opinions*, so how do I get those opinions to the rest of the world?
It's so easy actually, github pages has free hosting, and I can write something to make the page from my rambling in markdown.
Isn't that nice for me.

Anyway, this page should be incredibly temporary until I get something real set up.
