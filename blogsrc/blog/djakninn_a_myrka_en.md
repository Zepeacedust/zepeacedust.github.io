A long time ago there was a deacon in the village of Myrká^[Lit. "Dark River"] around Eyjafjörður^[A fjord in the north of Iceland, contains Akureyri, the second largest settlement in Iceland.]; his name is not recorded.
He was courting a woman by the name of Guðrún^[Roughly meaning "Friend of God"], by some accounts she lived at the village of Bægisá, on he other side of the river Hörgá, and was a maid to the priest there.
The deacon had a gray maned horse, he rode him often and called him Faxi^[Lit: "Mane"].
One time as little while before christmas, the deacon made his way to Bægisá and invited Guðrún to a christmas feast in Myrká, he promised to fetch her in time for the feast which was on christmas eve.

In the days before he went to invite her it had snowed considerably, and on that day it had started to melt. As the day passed and he tarried at Bægisá the river Hörgá had become impassable.
When he finally left he paid no mind to the changing conditions, and assumed that the river flowed as it had earlier. He crossed the river Yxnadalsá by bridge, but when he came to the river Hörgá it had shifted.
He rides along it until he reaches Saurbær, a town just below Myrká.
There was a bridge he could cross. The deacon rides over the bridge, but on the biddle it collapses and he falls into the river.
The morning after, as the farmer at Þúfnavöllur^[A neighboring town roughly between Myrká and Bægisá] was getting out of bed he sees Faxi and the bottom of his field and recognizes him as the deacons horse.
This shakes him a little, as he saw the deacon on his travels to Bægisá just the day before, but hadn't heard any news of his return. He quickly clues in to what must have happened and walks out to see Faxi soaking wet and worse for wear.
He clambers down a steep slope down to the riverbank and finds the deacon washed up. He hurries to Myrká with the news.
The deacon was badly injured at the back of the head, seemingly by an iceberg. He was moved back to Myrká and buried in the week before christmas.

After the deacon left Bægisá and until christmas eve, no news could cross between the villages due to the river being impassable.
But as the weather calms just before christmas, the river does as well, and Guðrún is relieved that she will not miss the feast.
She starts preparing for the journey, and when she is mostly finished there is a knock at the door. Another woman at the town answers the door and sees nobody, as it is in the twilight hours and the moon seldom peeks between the clouds.
The woman returns and claims to not have seen anything, and Guðrún says:

> They are calling for me, and I shall greet them.

<aside>
> Til mín mun leikurinn gjörður, og skal ég að vísu út ganga.
</aside>


She had almost finished dressing, only missing her coat. She hurredly slipped on one sleeve, but laid the other over her shoulder and held it there.
When she came out, she saw Faxi stand by the door, and a man she assumed was the deacon. 
It is not known whether they talked at all, but he took Guðrún and sat her on the horse, and himself in front of her.
They rode that way for a while without talking, when they came to the river Hörgá the horse jumped over it, and the deacons hat lifted so Guðrún could see the back of his head, and the exposed skull.
At that moment the moon appeared from amidst the clouds and the deacon spoke:

> the moon wains,  
> And death rides.  
> Do you see a white spot  
> on the back of my head,  
> Garún[Ghosts, in icelandic folklore, are believed to be unable to speak the name God, in icelandic "Guð", leading to the deacon prounouncing the name "Guðrún" as "Garún"], Garún^[In icelandic folklore, ghosts were believed to talk in verse, and often repeat words.]?

<aside>
> Máninn líður,  
> dauðinn ríður;  
> sérðu ekki hvítan blett  
> í hnakka mínum,  
> Garún, Garún?  
</aside>

This frightened her, and she dared not speak. But some say that she lifted his hat, and saw his skull and said

> I see that which is there.

<aside>

> Sé ég það, sem er.

</aside>

Nothing more is said of their conversation before they arrive at Myrká, and disembarked before the gate to the cemetary^[In icelandic, the gate to a cemetary is called "Sálihliðið", Lit. "gate of souls"], where the deacon again speaks:

> Wait here, Garún, Garún,  
> while I move Faxi, Faxi,  
> up to the fields, fields.  

<aside>

> Bíddu hérna, Garún, Garún,  
> meðan eg flyt hann Faxa, Faxa,  
> upp fyrir garða, garða."  

</aside>

He quickly left with the horse, but Guðrún cast her eyes to the cemetary.
There she saw an open grave and was frightened. She grabs the bell rope to steady herself and in that moment is grabbed from behind.
Luckily she hadn't fully donned her cloak, since she was then pulled with enough force to rip the sleeve from the cloak at the seams.
The last she saw of the deacon, is as he falls with the torn cloak into the open grave. The force of the impact collapsing the walls and burying him.

In her terror Guðrún rang the bell ceaselessly until a group from Myrká came to fetch her. She neither dared to stop, nor leave, as she thought it sure that she saw the deacon back from the dead, even without having heard news of his death.
The same night, well after dark, the deacon came again to Myrká seeking Guðrún. The commotion was so great that the entire village was roused and nobody could sleep again till morning.
For half a month afterwards Guðrún did not dare to be alone, and she could not sleep unless someone was awake.
Some even say that she needed the priest to sit at her bedside and read from his psalter till she finally fell asleep..

Peace did not come until they sought a sorcerer^[The word used is "galdramaður", translating more generally to "Magic man", exorcist wouldn't be wrong either]
from Skagafjörður^[A neighboring Fjörd, but still quite a distance.].
He made them dig up a large rock from one of the fields, and roll it into the village.
That night, as the deacon again comes for Guðrún, the sorcerer forces him south with powerful incantations, and into a grave prepared earlier that day.
Then the villagers roll the stone over the grave, and there it is said that the deacon is still trapped to this day.
But afterwards the hauntings at Myrká stopped, and shortly afterwards Guðrún went home to Bægisá.
It is said that she was never quite the same afterwards.
