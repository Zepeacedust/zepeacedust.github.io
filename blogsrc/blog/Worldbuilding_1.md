One afternoon a few years ago, at a game night with a few friends, I had an idea. 
By now that idea has been stewing in my brain and changing each time I think about it.
This is one snapshot of that idea, somewhat similar to the original concept, 
I will relay the history of the world itself and its creation.

We make all of these worlds, acting like demiurges with out subcreation, and then we inevitably discard them.
After we stop working on these worlds, they slowly get forgotten, details disappear
and things smooth out until the only thing left is the vague impression in our minds.
But what if the memory found a way to remember itself?

That little spark set my mind in motion, and a week or so later I was walking home from another session.
It was after dark, it had snowed earlier and the wind had blown the loose snow away creating the impression of small glaciers.
In the half-dark between streetlights I started thinking of a world with settlements huddling around tiny pockets of warmth, light
and substantivity.

For such a dark arctic environment, I though that the sun must have either gone dark or disappeared.
Keeping with the "players as missing gods" you could easily just claim that the sun was one of or all of the gods.

## Then the creation myth

In the beginning, there were four gods, The Eldest, The Warrior, The Trickster, and The Youngest.
When the gods first convened, they marked out the four corners of the world, and set to sculpting the land.
For a long while they worked, with dispute after dispute being mediated by the Eldest, 
the Warrior raised great mountains, the trickster filled the oceans with saltwater and elusive fish,
and the Youngest made between them beaches and plains. The Eldest wrote down each thing that was created in a ledger so it would know its place.

When the long work was done, the Youngest sculpted a clay figure in her own image and she made it walk and sing and dance along the beaches.
The eldest was infuriated by this, as the figure disturbed grains of sand from their rightful place, in his rage he struck the figure with enough
force to make mountains erupt into volcanoes, the oceans spill across the beaches and split the land into many pieces.
The others were enraged by this, and the Trickster asked the Warrior and the Youngest why they follow such a tyrant?
They contrived to kill the Eldest, the youngest forged the warriors hands into weapons, the Trickster bade the Eldest
to meet him on the higest mountain peak, for he had heard the others plot against him. But he was ambushed by the warrior 
who killed him and cast his body into the skies where it lost its inner light and still remains as the moon.
This killing created death, which will claim all things.

The three remaining looked out on the world and saw that it was vast but empty, so they made new beings to do their bidding and build great wonders for their glory.
First the youngest took the clay of the earth and fashioned from it humankind, beings of meat and bone, who dreamed and wondered at the world.
They set forth to build great towers for their gods, but they were short lived, and few completed their towers before disease or disaster took them.
The warrior was disgusted at their frailty, and he took stones from the roots of the mountains and forged them into dwarves, stony and imperishable.
Dwarves were complete from the moment of their creation, but without the spark of imagination they could not truly create. They built great cities that stood empty
and beautiful temples that went unused.
The trickster saw the failure of both the warrior and the youngest, and so set about to make a new race.
He took silver from the mountains and made from it an imperishable heart, around the heart he shaped a body of timber and leaves that could grow and adapt.
But these elves looked at the world and saw only dirt and stone, so the Trickster called the youngest to a banquet of poisoned meats and deadly plants.
As the youngest ate she became weak and feeble, seeing this he reached into her being and drew out her creative spark, this spark he set in the heart of his elves.
This spark would teach them to see beauty in the world and how to create it.
The youngest would soon waste away from the poisons, this killing tought death to take the young with disease.

The trickster tought the elves to work wood, stone and metal, and they dictated the dwarves' labour. Before long the whole world was full of wonders.
For many years the warrior walked the earth, investigating each creation and marveling at their beauty, until at last
he came across the banquet hall where the youngest had been killed, the sight enraged him and he hacked the trickster to pieces with his sword-hands.
This tought death to take the healthy by warfare.

Having seen all that the world had to offer, the warrior took the elves and left to create a new world where there was space for more wonders.

## Latter days
With the warrior gone, the world was dark. and as the years passed it faded from his memory. 
Many wonders were lost to the mists of sands, and great cities were forgotten as the world became less substantial by the day.
But the wisest of mankind still remembered the Youngest, and they found that the banquet hall that became her tomb was as still as solid as the ancient days.

They studied her corpse and deduced that she must still remember and witness the world.
With great labour they dismantled the works of the elves, and instructed the dwarves in the construction of clockwork replicas of her out of golden cogs.
These replicas were fed by scribes the events of the world around them, and all that they remember does not fade.
But the dwarves one by one returned to inanimate rock, and the world around the 
clockwork replicas grew colder mankind huddled around the heat and light of their gods.

Being made by man, these god-machines were imperfect, and they slowly fell into the cognitive traps that man makes for himself.
Where the cause was forgotten, a new spirit is formed, and fact becomes indistinguishable from fiction.
Cultural memories of the suns become the princess aurora, which shelters the lost and guides travellers.

As time goes by, these god-machines deteriorate, and the knowledge to repair them has been long lost, 
the myths of ancient texts detailing their creations never seem to come true.
Stories of the codex of the eldest seem to crop up, the book where the correct state of the world was written.
Many want to find them, and some believe that if they have it they could rewrite the fabic of the world itself.
Others believe that the eldest was a fool, and that finding the book would lock the world in stasis forever, the god-machines must be studied and replicated once more.
Yet others believe that it is a myth, and that the way to heal the world is to restore the Youngest, as a god she could observe the world all at once and stabilize it.
Fringe groups try to fabricate reports of mythical treasure, and when they are entered into the god-machines they rush out to be the first to find them.

## What now?
This setting is a world still in flux, literally and metaphorically.
Depeding on what happens the world could slowly decay, stabilize as it is, be restored to its original glory or be reshaped by men turned gods.
It is also only defined in the broadest strokes, with no names or detailed histories. If I ever find the time to play in it expect more detail on places and people.
