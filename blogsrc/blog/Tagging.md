So, I want to talk about a lot of things, but I understant that not everyone is interested in all of those things.

So I am introducing **Tags**, neat little things that help me organize my rants into neat little slices, each with their own index.

The note that I will probably bastardize the codebase that generates this site has already come true, not even a day later I have hacked some new functionality into an already dubiously clean codebase.
I should eventually clean that up.

The current tags as of posting are as follows: [Meta](/blog/index_meta.html) for things related to the blog itself and [Coding](/blog/index_coding.html) for my software misadventures. 
That number will most certainly grow and there should be a system already in place to create new indices and link to those indices from other indices.
