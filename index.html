        <p>So, I was thinking, I dislike web design, but I have
        <em>opinions</em>, so how do I get those opinions to the rest of
        the world? It's so easy actually, github pages has free hosting,
        and I can write something to make the page from my rambling in
        markdown. Isn't that nice for me.</p>
        <p>Anyway, this page should be incredibly temporary until I get
        something real set up.</p>
